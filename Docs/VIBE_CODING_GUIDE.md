# Vibe Coding: A Complete Beginner-to-Production Guide

From Idea → Planning → AI Coding → Testing → Deployment → Production

---

## 1. The Complete Vibe Coding Workflow

Before writing any code, understand the entire process.

```
               IDEA
                  ↓
               RESEARCH
                  ↓
            DEFINE THE USER
                  ↓
                PRD
                  ↓
            CHOOSE TECH STACK
                  ↓
             ARCHITECTURE
                  ↓
                DESIGN
                  ↓
             PROJECT RULES
                  ↓
            TASK BREAKDOWN
                  ↓
               SETUP
                  ↓
             DEVELOPMENT
                  ↓
               TESTING
                  ↓
           SECURITY REVIEW
                  ↓
             CODE REVIEW
                  ↓
          PREVIEW DEPLOYMENT
                  ↓
              QA TESTING
                  ↓
           PRODUCTION DEPLOY
                  ↓
             MONITORING
                  ↓
              ITERATION
```

Never skip directly from:
**IDEA → AI → DEPLOY**

---

## 2. Step 1: Define What You Want to Build

Before opening your AI coding tool, answer five questions.

### 1. What problem are you solving?
*Example:*
College students struggle to organize assignments, notes and deadlines.

### 2. Who is the user?
*Example:*
BCA, BSc CS and BTech students.

### 3. What is the main outcome?
*Example:*
Give students one place to manage their academic work.

### 4. What is the MVP?
MVP means Minimum Viable Product.

For example:
- Authentication
- Dashboard
- Notes
- Assignments
- Deadlines

Don't start with:
- AI Tutor
- Community
- Payments
- Mobile App
- Gamification
- Social Feed

Build the core product first.

### 5. What is NOT part of the first version?
This is equally important.

*Example:*
Out of scope:
- Mobile application
- Payments
- AI chatbot
- Social features

This prevents AI from continuously expanding the project.

---

## 3. Step 2: Research Before Coding

Don't ask AI to build an idea that you haven't researched.

### Research:
- **Users**
  - Who needs this?
  - What are their problems?
  - What alternatives already exist?
- **Competitors**
  - Look at:
    - Features
    - UI
    - Pricing
    - User experience
    - Strengths
    - Weaknesses
- **Technical feasibility**
  - Check:
    - APIs
    - Authentication
    - Database requirements
    - Third-party services
    - Hosting
    - Cost

### AI tools can help with research
You can use:
- ChatGPT
- Perplexity
- Google
- Official documentation
- GitHub
- Stack Overflow

For technical decisions, prefer official documentation over random blog posts.

---

## 4. Step 3: Choose Your AI Coding Tool

Don't use the same tool for every project.

### For beginners
- **Replit**
  - Good when you want:
    - Browser-based development
    - Minimal setup
    - Quick prototypes
    - Full-stack experimentation
- **Lovable**
  - Good for:
    - Web apps
    - SaaS prototypes
    - UI-heavy applications
    - Rapid MVP development
- **Bolt**
  - Good for:
    - Fast web application prototypes
    - JavaScript/TypeScript projects
    - Browser-based development
- **Cursor**
  - Good when you want:
    - More control
    - Existing repositories
    - Larger projects
    - Local development
    - Professional development workflows
- **Claude Code**
  - Good for:
    - Terminal-based development
    - Larger codebases
    - Repository-level tasks
    - Agentic development workflows

---

## 6. Recommended Beginner Stack

If you're serious about learning development through vibe coding, this is a good starting stack:

- **AI IDE**: Cursor
- **Frontend**: Next.js
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / Supabase
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Version Control**: Git + GitHub
- **Testing**: Playwright
- **Deployment**: Vercel

---

## 7. Step 4: Install the Development Environment

For a typical web project, install:

### Required
1. Cursor or VS Code
2. Git
3. Node.js LTS
4. npm
5. GitHub account
6. Modern web browser

### Optional
- Docker
- GitHub CLI
- Postman / Bruno
- Database client
- Vercel CLI

Verify your installation:
```bash
node --version
npm --version
git --version
```

---

## 8. Step 5: Create Your Project

Create a project folder:
```bash
mkdir student-dashboard
cd student-dashboard
```

Initialize Git:
```bash
git init
```

Then create a GitHub repository.

From the beginning, your project should have version control.

**Why?**
Because AI can break your project.

Git gives you the ability to:
```
Change → Test → Break something → Compare → Rollback
```

---

## 9. Step 6: Create Your Project Documentation

This is one of the most important parts of structured vibe coding.

Before asking AI to build features, create your project context.

A professional project can have:
```
project/
│
├── docs/
│   ├── PRD.md
│   ├── ARCHITECTURE.md
│   ├── DESIGN.md
│   ├── TEST_PLAN.md
│   ├── SECURITY.md
│   ├── DECISIONS.md
│   └── MEMORY.md
│
├── .cursor/
│   └── rules/
│
├── src/
├── tests/
│
├── README.md
├── TASKS.md
├── .env.example
└── .gitignore
```

You don't need all of these for a tiny project.

For a beginner project, start with:
- PRD.md
- ARCHITECTURE.md
- DESIGN.md
- RULES.md
- TASKS.md
- README.md
- .env.example

---

## 10. Step 7: Create PRD.md

### What is PRD?
**PRD = Product Requirements Document**

It defines:
**What are we building and why?**

*Example:*
```markdown
# Product Requirements Document

## Product
StudentHub

## Problem
Students struggle to manage their academic notes, assignments and deadlines.

## Target Users
BCA, BSc CS and BTech students.

## Goal
Create a centralized academic productivity dashboard.

## Core Features
1. Authentication
2. Dashboard
3. Notes
4. Assignments
5. Deadlines

## MVP
- Signup
- Login
- Dashboard
- Create notes
- Edit notes
- Delete notes
- Create assignments

## Out of Scope
- Payments
- AI tutor
- Mobile app
- Social feed

## Success Criteria
A user should be able to:
1. Create an account
2. Login
3. Create a note
4. Edit a note
5. Delete a note
6. Create an assignment
7. Mark an assignment complete
```

**Remember: PRD = WHAT + WHY**

---

## 11. Step 8: Create ARCHITECTURE.md

This defines:
**How will the application work?**

*Example:*
```markdown
# Architecture

## Frontend
Next.js + TypeScript

## Styling
Tailwind CSS

## Backend
Next.js server-side functionality

## Database
Supabase PostgreSQL

## Authentication
Supabase Auth

## Deployment
Vercel

## Architecture
User → Next.js UI → Server Action / API → Supabase → PostgreSQL
```

Define your folder structure too:
```
src/
├── app/
├── components/
├── features/
├── services/
├── lib/
├── types/
└── utils/
```

Also define architectural rules.
*Example:*
- UI components should not contain database logic.
- Database operations belong in services.
- Authentication must be verified server-side.
- Reusable UI should be placed in components.
- Business logic should remain separate from UI.

**Remember: Architecture = HOW**

---

## 12. Step 9: Create DESIGN.md

This gives AI a consistent visual system.

Without it, you may get:
- Page 1 → rounded cards
- Page 2 → square cards
- Page 3 → different buttons
- Page 4 → completely different typography

Define:
```markdown
# Design System

## Style
Modern
Minimal
Professional

## Typography
Inter

## Colors
Primary: #6366F1
Background: #F8FAFC
Text: #0F172A
Muted: #64748B

## Buttons
Primary
Secondary
Destructive

## Cards
Border radius: 12px

## UX Requirements
- Mobile responsive
- Loading states
- Empty states
- Error states
- Accessible forms
```

**Remember: DESIGN.md = HOW IT SHOULD LOOK AND FEEL**

---

## 13. Step 10: Create RULES.md

This is your project's AI rulebook.

*Example:*
```markdown
# Development Rules

## General
- Use TypeScript.
- Reuse existing components.
- Do not duplicate logic.
- Keep functions small.
- Do not modify unrelated files.

## Before Coding
- Read the relevant project documentation.
- Inspect existing implementation.
- Reuse existing functionality where possible.
- Make a plan for large changes.

## UI
- Follow DESIGN.md.
- Maintain responsive design.
- Include loading states.
- Include error states.
- Include empty states.

## Security
- Never expose API keys.
- Validate user input.
- Verify authorization server-side.

## Testing
- Add tests for important functionality.
- Run tests after implementation.
- Fix failing tests before continuing.

## Git
- Make small commits.
- Use descriptive commit messages.
```

For Cursor, these rules can also be organized inside:
`.cursor/rules/`

For example:
```
.cursor/
└── rules/
    ├── general.mdc
    ├── frontend.mdc
    ├── backend.mdc
    └── testing.mdc
```

---

## 14. Step 11: Create TASKS.md

Never ask AI to build the entire application in one prompt.

Break the project into tasks.

```markdown
# Tasks

## Phase 1: Setup
- [ ] Initialize project
- [ ] Configure TypeScript
- [ ] Configure Tailwind
- [ ] Configure Git

## Phase 2: Authentication
- [ ] Create signup page
- [ ] Create login page
- [ ] Configure authentication
- [ ] Protect dashboard
- [ ] Test authentication

## Phase 3: Notes
- [ ] Create database table
- [ ] Create notes service
- [ ] Create notes UI
- [ ] Create note form
- [ ] Add edit functionality
- [ ] Add delete functionality
- [ ] Add tests
```

Then work like this:
```
TASK-001 → Implement → Test → Review → Mark complete → TASK-002
```

---

## 15. Step 12: Create DECISIONS.md

This stores important technical decisions.

*Example:*
```markdown
# Architecture Decisions

## ADR-001
Decision: Use Supabase for the database.
Reason: Provides PostgreSQL, authentication and backend services without managing our own infrastructure.

## ADR-002
Decision: Use Next.js instead of React + Express.
Reason: The application does not require a separate backend and we want a unified full-stack application.
```

This prevents AI from randomly changing architectural decisions later.

---

## 16. Step 13: Create MEMORY.md

Think of this as the project's current state.

*Example:*
```markdown
# Project Memory

## Current Status
Authentication completed.
Notes feature in progress.

## Completed
- Project setup
- Git setup
- Database setup
- Authentication

## Current Task
TASK-012

## Known Issues
- Mobile navbar needs improvement.
- Notes loading state is incomplete.

## Next Step
Complete note creation.
```

A useful distinction is:
- **DECISIONS.md**: Permanent decisions
- **MEMORY.md**: Current project state

---

## 17. Step 14: Create TEST_PLAN.md

Define what "working" actually means.

```markdown
# Test Plan

## Authentication
- User can signup
- User can login
- Invalid credentials show error
- Logged-out users cannot access dashboard

## Notes
- User can create note
- User can edit note
- User can delete note
- User cannot access another user's note

## Responsive
Test at:
- 375px
- 768px
- 1440px
```

This becomes your testing checklist later.

---

## 18. Step 15: Create SECURITY.md

For production projects:

```markdown
# Security Requirements

## Authentication
Private routes require authentication.

## Authorization
Users can only access resources they own.

## Secrets
Never expose secrets to client-side code.

## Database
Use appropriate access policies.

## Input
Validate all user input.

## APIs
Validate request body and parameters.

## File Uploads
Validate:
- File type
- File size
- Filename
```

Security should not be added five minutes before deployment.

---

## 19. Step 16: Create .env.example

Never put real API keys inside your source code.

Instead:
```env
DATABASE_URL=
SUPABASE_URL=
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
OPENAI_API_KEY=
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=
```

Then your local environment contains the real values (`.env.local`).
Your repository should contain `.env.example`, not your actual secrets.

---

## 20. Step 17: Give the AI Project Context

Now open your AI coding tool.

Don't immediately say:
> "Build my app."

Start with:
> Read the following files before making any changes:
> - PRD.md
> - ARCHITECTURE.md
> - DESIGN.md
> - RULES.md
> - TASKS.md
>
> Do not modify anything yet.
>
> First:
> 1. Understand the product.
> 2. Understand the architecture.
> 3. Review the design system.
> 4. Review the development rules.
> 5. Review the current tasks.
> 6. Identify missing information.
> 7. Explain the implementation plan for TASK-001.
>
> Do not write code yet.

This lets the AI understand the project before touching it.

---

## 21. Step 18: Build One Feature at a Time

Use this workflow:
```
Understand → Plan → Implement → Test → Review → Commit
```

For example:
- **TASK-001**: Create signup page
- **TASK-002**: Implement signup logic
- **TASK-003**: Add validation
- **TASK-004**: Add authentication tests

---

## 22. Step 19: Use Vertical Slices

Instead of building:
```
Entire frontend → Entire backend → Database
```

Build a complete user flow:
```
Signup → Login → Dashboard → Create Note → Save Note → Display Note
```
Then:
```
Edit Note → Save → Display updated note
```
Then:
```
Delete Note → Confirm → Database update → UI update
```

This makes debugging much easier.

---

## 23. Step 20: Use a Structured Prompt

A good coding prompt has six parts:
1. **CONTEXT**
2. **TASK**
3. **FILES**
4. **CONSTRAINTS**
5. **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**
6. **TESTING**

*Example:*
```
CONTEXT
We are building a student notes application.
Read PRD.md, ARCHITECTURE.md and RULES.md.

TASK
Implement note creation.

FILES
Relevant files:
src/features/notes/
src/services/
src/types/

CONSTRAINTS
- Follow the existing architecture.
- Reuse existing components.
- Do not create a second database layer.
- Do not modify unrelated files.
- Validate input.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- Logged-in user can create a note.
- Title is required.
- Content is required.
- Invalid input shows an error.
- Note is saved to the database.
- New note appears in the UI.

TESTING
Add appropriate tests.
Run lint.
Run type checking.
Run relevant tests.

After implementation, report:
1. Files changed
2. What was implemented
3. Tests executed
4. Remaining issues
```

---

## 24. Step 21: Never Give AI Huge Tasks

- **Bad**: Build the entire SaaS application.
- **Better**: Build authentication.
- **Best**: Create the signup UI. Do not implement authentication yet. Follow DESIGN.md. Requirements: Email field, Password field, Confirm password field, Validation, Loading state, Error state, Mobile responsive. Do not modify unrelated files.

Small tasks give AI less room to misunderstand your project.

---

## 25. Step 22: Test Every Feature

After implementing a feature:
```
Code → Lint → Type check → Unit tests → Integration tests → E2E tests
```

- Type check: `npm run typecheck`
- Lint: `npm run lint`
- Tests: `npm test`
- Build: `npm run build`

Your exact commands depend on the project's configuration.

---

## 26. Step 23: Use End-to-End Testing

E2E testing checks the application from the user's perspective.

For example:
```
Open website → Signup → Login → Create note → Refresh → Verify note exists → Edit note → Delete note → Logout
```

Tools such as Playwright are useful for automating browser-based tests.

---

## 27. Step 24: Review AI-Generated Code

Don't assume: *"It compiled, so it's correct."*

Ask the AI:
> Review the implementation against:
> - PRD.md
> - ARCHITECTURE.md
> - DESIGN.md
> - RULES.md
> - TEST_PLAN.md
> - SECURITY.md
>
> Check:
> - Correctness
> - Architecture
> - Security
> - Error handling
> - Accessibility
> - Responsive design
> - Performance
> - Code duplication
>
> Do not modify anything yet. Report all issues first.

Then fix them one by one.

---

## 28. Step 25: Learn How to Debug With AI

When something breaks, don't say: *"Fix this."*

Give the AI structured information:
```
ERROR
[paste error]

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR
The user should be redirected to the dashboard.

ACTUAL BEHAVIOR
The page shows a 500 error.

STEPS TO REPRODUCE
1. Login
2. Click Dashboard
3. Error appears

CONSTRAINT
Do not change the database schema.
```

Then ask:
> Do not modify code yet.
> Find the root cause.
> Explain:
> 1. What is failing?
> 2. Why is it failing?
> 3. Which file is responsible?
> 4. What is the smallest fix?
> 5. How will we test the fix?

Then:
> Implement the smallest fix.
> Do not refactor unrelated code.
> Run the relevant tests.

---

## 29. Step 26: Use Git Throughout Development

After a working feature:
```bash
git status
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add note creation"
git push
```

Use branches for larger projects:
```
main
│
├── feature/auth
├── feature/notes
├── feature/search
└── fix/mobile-navbar
```

This protects your working code from AI-generated mistakes.

---

## 30. Step 27: Prepare for Deployment

Before deployment, verify:

### Functionality
- [ ] Signup
- [ ] Login
- [ ] Logout
- [ ] CRUD operations
- [ ] Forms
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Loading states
- [ ] Empty states

### UI
- [ ] Mobile
- [ ] Tablet
- [ ] Desktop
- [ ] Accessibility
- [ ] Keyboard navigation

### Security
- [ ] No secrets in Git
- [ ] Authentication verified
- [ ] Authorization verified
- [ ] Database security configured
- [ ] Input validation
- [ ] API validation

### Code
- [ ] TypeScript passes
- [ ] Lint passes
- [ ] Tests pass
- [ ] Production build passes

---

## 31. Step 28: Deploy to Preview First

Your deployment pipeline should look like:
```
LOCAL → PREVIEW → QA → PRODUCTION
```

Never make production your first testing environment.

For example:
```
feature/notes → Preview deployment → Test → Fix → Merge → Production
```

---

## 32. Step 29: Deploy to Production

For a Next.js application, Vercel is one common deployment option.

The general workflow is:
```
GitHub repository → Connect to Vercel → Configure environment variables → Deploy → Preview URL → Test → Production
```

You can also use the Vercel CLI when appropriate:
```bash
vercel
```
After testing:
```bash
vercel --prod
```

---

## 33. Step 30: Configure Environment Variables

Your local environment might contain `.env.local`. Production should have its own values.

For example:
- **Development**: `DATABASE_URL=development-db`
- **Preview**: `DATABASE_URL=staging-db`
- **Production**: `DATABASE_URL=production-db`

Don't assume your local environment is identical to production.

---

## 34. Step 31: Production QA

After deployment, test the actual live application. Don't only test localhost.

Check:
```
Live URL → Signup → Login → Core features → Database operations → Error handling → Mobile → Desktop
```

Also test:
- Refreshing pages
- Direct URLs
- Logged-out access
- Invalid inputs
- Slow network
- Empty database
- Wrong credentials

---

## 35. Step 32: Monitor the Application

Deployment isn't the end. The production lifecycle is:
```
Deploy → Monitor → Collect feedback → Find bugs → Fix → Test → Deploy again
```

Consider adding:
- Error tracking
- Analytics
- Performance monitoring
- Database backups
- Uptime monitoring

---

## 36. Step 33: Maintain Project Documentation

As the project changes, update:
- `TASKS.md`
- `MEMORY.md`
- `DECISIONS.md`
- `README.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`

Don't let documentation describe an application that no longer exists. The AI needs accurate context.

---

## 37. The Recommended Project Structure

For a serious beginner project:
```
student-dashboard/
│
├── docs/
│   ├── PRD.md
│   ├── ARCHITECTURE.md
│   ├── DESIGN.md
│   ├── TEST_PLAN.md
│   ├── SECURITY.md
│   ├── DECISIONS.md
│   └── MEMORY.md
│
├── .cursor/
│   └── rules/
│       ├── general.mdc

│
├── public/
│
├── .env.example
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── TASKS.md
├── package.json
└── ...
```

---

## 38. What Each File Does

| File | Purpose | Stage |
|---|---|---|
| **PRD.md** | What are we building? | Planning |
| **ARCHITECTURE.md** | How will we build it? | Planning |
| **DESIGN.md** | How should it look? | Planning |
| **RULES.md** | How should AI code? | Planning |
| **TASKS.md** | What should we build next? | Development |
| **DECISIONS.md** | Why did we make this decision? | Development |
| **MEMORY.md** | What is the current project state? | Development |
| **TEST_PLAN.md** | How do we verify it? | Testing |
| **SECURITY.md** | How do we protect it? | Development |
| **.env.example** | What configuration is required? | Setup |
| **README.md** | How do humans use the project? | Documentation |

---

## 39. The Minimum Setup for Beginners

If all of this feels overwhelming, start with only:
```
my-project/
│
├── PRD.md
├── RULES.md
├── TASKS.md
├── README.md
├── .env.example
│
└── src/
```

Then add:
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `DESIGN.md`
- `TEST_PLAN.md`
- `SECURITY.md`
- `DECISIONS.md`
- `MEMORY.md`

as your project becomes more complex.

---

## 40. The Professional Vibe Coding Loop

For every feature, follow this exact loop:

```
1. READ
   ↓
2. UNDERSTAND
   ↓
3. PLAN
   ↓
4. IMPLEMENT
   ↓
5. TEST
   ↓
6. REVIEW
   ↓
7. FIX
   ↓
8. COMMIT
   ↓
9. UPDATE DOCUMENTATION
```

Then move to the next feature.
